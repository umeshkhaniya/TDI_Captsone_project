# Potential Solar Market
This project is to analyze solar radiation based on the latitude and longitude data. We will also use the Photovoltaic (PV) rooftop database to find the potential region for the solar panel. This project will accurately predict the potential place for solar industry.

# Introduction: 
Solar power is a clean and  renewable source of energy. As the world is moving to clean energy, the urban solar market has a great future in the world.
Therefore, analyzing the solar power market in the USA is very important for solar industries. By keeping in mind, I am planning to use a  Photovoltaic (PV) rooftop database such that only PV rooftops can be able to build up at least one solar panel.


I am proposing this project for the data incubator data engineering program. In this project, I will have large data sets from the solar radiation database from NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) and the Photovoltaic (PV) rooftop database. The plan here is to use Amazon S3 for data storage, Apache Spark for data processing, PostgreSQL for data storage database.  Airflow will be used to monitor the ETL workflow pipeline and Tableau will be used to visualize the final dataset.
